# Macrosilicon Custom Firmware

Custom EEPROM firmware for Macrosilicon USB video chips, adding
host-accessible features via a mailbox protocol over the existing HID
interface. No hardware modification required — just reflash the EEPROM.

## Supported Chips

| Chip | Function | Status | Features |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| **MS2107** | CVBS/S-Video to USB capture | Working | Signal status, image adjust, input select, GPIO, I2C master |
| **MS9123** | USB to CVBS/S-Video display | Working | Display status, DAC control, GPIO, I2C master |
| **MS2109** | HDMI to USB capture | Working | HDMI capture, signal detection, I2C master, GPIO, PID override |

## What's New Over Stock

The stock EEPROM firmware handles signal detection and video configuration
but exposes no user-accessible interface. This project adds:

- **Host command mailbox** — read signal status, video parameters, and
  hardware state over USB HID without any driver changes
- **I2C master** — turn the dongle into a USB-to-I2C bridge for
  communicating with sensors, EEPROMs, or other devices on the board
- **GPIO read/write** — direct port access for hardware debugging
- **Image adjustment** (MS2107) — brightness, contrast, saturation, hue
- **Video input switching** (MS2107) — force CVBS, S-Video, or auto-detect
- **DAC control** (MS9123) — read/write the 10-bit video DAC
- **Test pattern generator** — send SMPTE bars, PM5544, or solid colors
  to the MS9123 display adapter directly via USB (no drivers needed)
- **USB PID override** (MS2109) — customize the USB product ID at build time
- **Editable EDID** (MS2109) — customize the HDMI EDID the source device sees

## How It Works

These USB video dongles contain an 8051 microcontroller that loads firmware
from an external I2C EEPROM (24C16) at boot. The mask ROM provides the base
USB video functionality; the EEPROM firmware extends it with signal detection,
video configuration, and interrupt handling.

All Macrosilicon devices expose a 9-byte HID feature report interface for
reading and writing XDATA (external RAM). The firmware places a command
mailbox at a known XDATA address. The host writes a command byte, waits
briefly, then reads back the response:

```python
from ms_hid import MSDevice

with MSDevice(vid=0x534D, pid=0x2109) as d:
    # Write command 0x01 (signal status)
    d.xdata_write(0xDE00, 0x01)
    time.sleep(0.05)

    # Read status and response
    status = d.xdata_read(0xDE03)  # 0x02 = done
    signal = d.xdata_read(0xDE04)  # signal state
```

The `ms_hid.py` library in `tools/` wraps the raw HID protocol.

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `tools/ms_hid.py` | HID communication library (XDATA/EEPROM read/write) |
| `tools/ms_movc_dump.py` | CODE space dump via RAM-patched MOVC handler |
| `tools/ms_xdata_dump.py` | Full XDATA dump (single-byte reads) |
| `tools/ms_eeprom_checksum.py` | EEPROM checksum calculator |
| `tools/ms_testpattern.py` | USB display test pattern generator (SMPTE, PM5544, etc.) |
| `tools/bp5_eeprom.py` | Bus Pirate 5 EEPROM recovery tool |

## MS2107 (CVBS Capture)

Mailbox at XDATA `0xD210-0xD219`. Written in C with SDCC.

| Command | Feature | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| 0x01 | Signal status | NTSC/PAL detection, lock state, line count |
| 0x02 | Image read | Brightness, contrast, saturation, hue values |
| 0x03 | Image write | Set brightness/contrast/saturation/hue |
| 0x04 | Input select | Force CVBS, S-Video, G1IN, or auto-detect |
| 0x05 | GPIO read | P0, P2, P3 port states |
| 0x06 | GPIO write | Set P0, P2, or P3 port values |
| 0x10 | I2C write | Send byte to I2C device |
| 0x11 | I2C read | Read byte from I2C device register |
| 0x12 | I2C scan | Scan 6 addresses, return bitmap |
| 0xFE | Identify | Returns "@kraln" |

The I2C master turns the capture dongle into a USB-to-I2C bridge — useful for
communicating with sensors, EEPROMs, or other I2C devices on the same board.

### Building and Flashing (MS2107)

```bash
cd ms2107/eeprom
make

# Custom USB strings
make CUSTOM_STRINGS='-DCUSTOM_USB_SERIAL="\"MySerial\""'
```

Flash via `ms_hid.py` or any I2C programmer:

```python
from ms_hid import MSDevice

with MSDevice(vid=0x534D, pid=0x2109) as d:
    eeprom = open("eeprom_image.bin", "rb").read()
    d.eeprom_write_block(0, eeprom)
    # Power cycle to boot new firmware
```

## MS9123 (USB Display Adapter)

Mailbox at XDATA `0xDDF0-0xDDF9`. Written in C with SDCC.

| Command | Feature | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| 0x01 | Display status | Mode, output params, host connection state |
| 0x03 | DAC read | 10-bit DAC samples and config registers |
| 0x04 | DAC write | Set DAC configuration (F880/F005/F020) |
| 0x05 | GPIO read | P0, P2, P3, P3ALT, DAC readback |
| 0x06 | GPIO write | Set P0, P2, or P3 port values |
| 0x10 | I2C write | Send byte to I2C device (7-bit addr) |
| 0x11 | I2C read | Read byte from I2C device register |
| 0x12 | I2C scan | Scan 8 addresses, return bitmap |
| 0xFE | Identify | Returns "@kraln" |

PAL/NTSC mode switching is host-side via the 0xA6 protocol (mode
0x0200=NTSC 720x480, 0x1100=PAL 720x576). The `ms_testpattern.py`
tool handles this automatically.

### Building and Flashing (MS9123)

```bash
cd ms9123/eeprom
make
```

Flash the same way as MS2107 (adjust VID:PID as needed).

## MS2109 (HDMI Capture)

Mailbox at XDATA `0xDE00-0xDE07`. Written in pure 8051 assembly.

| Command | Feature | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| 0x01 | Signal status | HDMI signal state, chip ID |
| 0x05 | GPIO read | P0, P2, P3 port states |
| 0x11 | I2C read | Read byte from I2C device register |
| 0x12 | I2C scan | Scan 0x50-0x57, return bitmap |
| 0xFE | Identify | Returns "@kraln" |

USB PID is configurable at build time (edit `_set_usb_pid` in crt0).
EDID, video timing table, and register configuration are editable in
the assembly source.

### Building and Flashing (MS2109)

```bash
cd ms2109/eeprom
make
```

The MS2109 firmware is pure assembly (sdas8051 + sdld). No C compiler needed
beyond what SDCC provides.

### EEPROM Recovery (MS2109)

If a bad firmware prevents USB enumeration, the EEPROM can be rewritten
in-circuit using an I2C programmer (Bus Pirate, CH341, etc.):

- Supply voltage: **2.5V** (at 3.3V the MS2109 back-powers through board
  traces and interferes with I2C writes)
- USB cable **disconnected** from the target device
- EEPROM WP pin grounded
- EEPROM type: 24C16 (2KB, 8 block addresses 0x50-0x57)

A known-good minimal firmware (`eeprom_minimal_test.bin`, 33 bytes) is
included for recovery testing.

## Architecture Notes

### EEPROM Format

All Macrosilicon chips use a 2KB I2C EEPROM with this layout:

```
[0x00-0x01]  Magic (0x0816 for MS2107, 0xA55A for MS2109/MS9123)
[0x02-0x03]  Code length (big-endian, determines checksum position)
[0x04-0x07]  VID/PID (MS2107) or hook config (MS2109/MS9123)
[0x08-0x0F]  Hook flags + config bytes
[0x10-0x2F]  USB string descriptors (MS2107 only)
[0x30+]      Firmware code (loaded to XDATA at boot)
[0x30+len]   Checksums (uint16 BE: header + code)
```

Power cycling causes the mask ROM to reload the EEPROM. The original
firmware can always be restored by reflashing a backup.

### Calling Conventions

The mask ROM appears to use Keil-style calling conventions. The MS2107
and MS9123 firmware is compiled with SDCC, which uses different conventions:

| | ROM (Keil-style) | SDCC (firmware) |
|--|----------------|-----------------|
| First uint8_t arg | R7 | DPL |
| Return value | R7 / carry | DPL |

The custom crt0 assembly handles bridging between conventions. The MS2109
firmware is pure assembly and calls ROM functions directly without bridging.

IRQ handlers are written in assembly on all three chips. The mask ROM's
USB stack is sensitive to exact instruction sequences in interrupt context.
